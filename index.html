                Quality Training, <br />
                With Your Needs in Mind
              </h3>

            <p>
              At Intuitive Fitness we believe the greatest investment anyone can
              make is taking care of one's health. By taking a preventative
              maintenance approach through exercise we can fight off illnesses,
              disease and even prevent injury- all while improving an
              individual's ability to move.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We recognize that everyone's movement ability is different.
              Whether you are coming back to exercise after a long time away, if
              you have never exercised before, or you are a professional athlete
              looking to take your fitness to the next level, exercising with
              the guidance of a trainer is the best way for any individual to
              meet their health and fitness goals while learning one's movements
              safely and effectively through progression.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With that being said- no one's movement is perfect! We like to
              say- even trainers need trainers!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We create custom tailored programming to meet individual's needs
              and take them through extensive 30 or 55 minute exercise sessions.
