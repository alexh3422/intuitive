            Intuitive Fitness was created because Tom wanted a wider reach to
            help more individuals, and understood that working within a
            traditional gym had its limits. Gyms were too crowded for clients to
            get continued quality service, and clients had to pay gym membership
            fees on top of personal training rates. He wanted to inspire others
            who may not be members of the gym or any fitness club; people who
            wanted a lifestyle change or to gain better movement habits, with no
            exercise history and no prerequisites required in order to see him.
            At Intuitive Fitness there are no membership fees, and there is
            total privacy within our private studio space or any in-home
            environment. There is no equipment necessary, and most importantly
            anyone can access affordable, professional, customized personal
            training.

            “Health and fitness have always been a huge part of my life. In
            2009, while going through an intense training regimen for junior
            Olympics in Tae Kwon Doe I developed a passion for traditional
            strength training and metabolic conditioning. My specialties include
            one-on-one personal training, small group training, kickboxing,
            kettlebells, weight training, form & technique correction, and
            Olympic Weight Lifting. My priorities when training my clients are
            to develop proper functional movement and form while completing
            exercises, correct muscle imbalances, decrease risk for injury,
            inspire positive lifestyle change and counsel clients on proper
            nutrition and exercise habits. I have worked with individuals from
            many walks of life, a variety of age ranges, from all fitness levels
            with success. I am very excited to continue my passion of helping
            others develop themselves and spread the power of health and
            fitness.” - Tom Studzinski
